# ðŸ•¶ file-mapper

**file-mapper** is a versatile CLI tool that combines the power of the Linux **`tree`** command (for hierarchical directory listings) and the **`cat`** command (for file content viewing)â€”all rolled into one convenient package. Recursively map out your project structure, filter files, and optionally display file contents (with features like line numbering). It's ideal for developers who want a comprehensive project overview or need to share both file structure and content with others (e.g., in code reviews or AI tools).

## Features

1. **Tree or Flat**
    - By default, `file-mapper` displays a **hierarchical tree** of your files and directories (like `tree`).
    - Use the `--flat` flag for a **flat** listing instead.

2. **Git-Tracked-Only**
    - Restrict the output to only files that are **tracked by Git** (`--git`).

3. **Include / Exclude Patterns**
    - Filter specific file types (e.g. `--include="*.go,*.md"`)
    - Exclude directories/files (e.g. `--exclude=".git,node_modules"`).

4. **Hidden & Binary Skips**
    - Hidden files/directories (those starting with `.`) are **ignored by default**.
    - Uses a naive approach to skip **binary** files.

5. **Content Viewing**
    - **Inline** content right below each file (similar to `cat`, but recursive) (`--content`).
    - Or **separate**: list all files, then dump their contents afterward.
    - Enable **line numbers** (`--line-numbers`) for quick reference.
    - Show or hide content headers (`----- CONTENT START -----` / `----- CONTENT END -----`).

6. **Output to File**
    - Save your entire listing and contents to a file (`--output=out.txt`).

## Why Use file-mapper?

- **One-Stop Command**: Instead of running `tree` to see the structure and then `cat` or `less` for file contents, `file-mapper` does it **all in one go**, recursively.
- **Share With AI or Peers**: Perfect for pasting a projectâ€™s structure and file contents into ChatGPT or sending it to teammates.
- **Saves Time**: No manual copy-pasting or multiple commandsâ€”filter, track only Git files, and see everything at a glance.

## Installation

### 1. Homebrew (macOS 10.12+)
If youâ€™re on macOS, you can install **file-mapper** via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install sky93/file-mapper/file-mapper
```

### 2. Prebuilt Binaries (Windows, macOS, Linux)
You can download a prebuilt binary for your operating system from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sky93/file-mapper/releases) page. Once downloaded, simply place the executable in your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux or somewhere in your `PATH` on Windows).

### 3. Install via Go
If you have Go installed and prefer installing from source, you can do:
```bash
go install github.com/sky93/file-mapper/cmd/file-mapper@latest
```
> This command fetches and installs the latest version of **file-mapper** from the GitHub repo, placing the binary in your Go `bin` folder (usually `~/go/bin`).

> **Tip**: Ensure your `~/go/bin` (or the equivalent on your system) is in your `$PATH` so that you can run `file-mapper` from anywhere.

## Usage

Once installed:

```bash
file-mapper [flags...]
```

Alternatively, if you cloned the repo locally and want to run without installing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sky93/file-mapper.git
cd file-mapper/cmd/projectMapper
go run main.go [flags...]
```

## Examples

1. **Default Tree**
   ```bash
   file-mapper
   ```
    - Displays the folder/file structure in a tree.
    - Skips hidden directories and binary files.

2. **Display File Contents Inline**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --content
   ```
    - Combines tree + `cat` for each file, printing content right below the file.

3. **Only Git-Tracked Files**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --git
   ```
    - Recursively traverses your directories, showing **only** files tracked by Git.

4. **Tree + Separate Content**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --content --separate-content
   ```
    - Prints the tree, then appends file contents at the end.

5. **Flat Listing**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --flat
   ```
    - Shows a simple list of files/directories.

6. **Include/Exclude Patterns**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --include="*.go,*.txt" --exclude=".git,.idea,node_modules"
   ```

7. **Output to a File**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --output=map.txt
   ```
    - Saves the entire listing and optional content to `map.txt`.

8. **Line Numbers + Content**
   ```bash
   file-mapper --content --line-numbers
   ```
